IDEAS

MAIN IDEA: Fulguratio
control lightning and other elements

turns into fungal magic mod for the late game

-add a taser
-add armor
-add magic with the essence stuff and essence crafting
    -this can be something like magical alchemy crafting? being high can help with ideas
        -fulgurium is used as the catalyst or something and you combine different elements to make new ones
    -awakened fulgurium stuff (stronger basic fulgurium tools, more things to do with it)

-matgic weapons from the crafting or something

-probably a book at some point


TODO in order
    -armor and tools
    -textures for elements
    -element crafting
    -special weapons + taser
